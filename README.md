## Objective

To explore and visualize the factors influencing employee attrition by analyzing relationships between **age, dependents, promotions, income, job level, leadership roles, distance from home, and remote work**. The goal is to help HR teams make informed, data-driven decisions for better retention strategies.

## Dataset Overview

* **Source:** [Kaggle — Employee Attrition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/employee-attrition-dataset)
* **Records:** 74,498 simulated employee samples
* **Features:** 22 variables including demographics, job level, salary, promotions, and remote work status.

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of the key attributes that impact whether an employee stays or leaves an organization.

## Key Insights & Findings

### 1. **Age and Dependents**

* Highest attrition observed among **employees aged 18–32**.
* Employees **without dependents** had the highest attrition rate (~0.5), indicating that personal responsibilities may promote long-term commitment.

### 2. **Promotions and Monthly Income**

* Employees with **no promotions** show higher attrition despite similar income levels.
* **Career advancement opportunities** have a stronger impact on retention than salary increases alone.

### 3. **Job Level and Tenure**

* **Entry-level employees** exhibit high attrition during their first 10 years, especially around year 7.
* **Mid- and senior-level staff** show lower attrition, suggesting higher job stability with experience.

### 4. **Leadership Opportunities**

* Employees in **leadership positions** experience higher attrition early in their tenure (attrition rate ~0.8 within 10 years), possibly due to elevated stress and expectations.
* Over time, leadership attrition decreases, but still contributes to over 50% total attrition in this group.

### 5. **Remote Work and Commute Distance**

* Employees **commuting >50 miles** show steadily rising attrition rates.
* **Remote workers** demonstrate stronger long-term stability, supporting hybrid or flexible work models.

## Tools and Techniques

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Techniques Used:**

  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Correlation and Distribution Analysis
  * Density Plots, Line Charts, Histograms
  * Data Grouping and Statistical Summaries
  * Attrition Rate Trend Visualization

---

## Key Takeaways

* **Career development** and **promotion frequency** are stronger retention drivers than salary.
* **Younger employees** and **those without dependents** are more likely to leave early.
* **Remote work** opportunities reduce attrition for employees with long commutes.
* **Leadership stress** contributes to early attrition; mentorship and workload balance can help mitigate this.

---

## Conclusion

By combining data visualization and analytics, this project provides a clear picture of employee behavior and turnover patterns. It enables HR departments to:

* Identify at-risk employee segments
* Build **targeted retention programs**
* Implement **data-driven HR strategies** to strengthen workforce stability.

This analysis shows that HR analytics can transform raw employee data into actionable insights that support sustainable organizational growth.
